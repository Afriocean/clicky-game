# Clicky Game

Clicky Game is a memory game built with React.

This app breaks up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The application renders different images (based on best 40 cartoon characters of all time) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
